## Developing

### Set up

This is no different than other Rust projects.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/guapodero/perfume
cd perfume
cargo test
```

### Useful Commands

Be aware that there is an optional `nightly` feature which requires
[nightly rust](https://ehuss.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html#working-with-nightly-rust).

Some of the tests depend on generated code, which is why there is a `main.rs`.

- Run Clippy:

  ```shell
  cargo clippy --all-targets -F codegen --workspace
  ```

  or
  ```shell
  cargo +nightly clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Run all tests: (after running `cargo run -F codegen`)

  ```shell
  cargo test -F codegen --workspace
  ```

  or
  ```shell
  cargo +nightly test --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Check to see if there are code formatting issues

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  ```

- Format the code in the project

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all
  ```

- Generate documentation (requires nightly channel)

  ```shell
  RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly doc --no-deps --all-features
  ```
